# User Journey Diagram

> User journeys describe at a high level of detail exactly what steps different users take to complete a specific task within a system, application or website. This technique shows the current (as-is) user workflow, and reveals areas of improvement for the to-be workflow. (Wikipedia)

Mermaid can render user journey diagrams:

```mermaid-example
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 5: Me
```

```mermaid
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 5: Me
```

Each user journey is split into sections, these describe the part of the task
the user is trying to complete.

Tasks syntax is `Task name: <score>: <comma separated list of actors>`
